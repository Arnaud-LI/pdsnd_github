### Project Title
:snake: **Python Explorer for US Bikeshare Data** :bike:

### Description
The bikeshare.py Python code is able to answer interesting questions about bikeshare trip data collected from three US cities (Chicago, New York City & Washington)
The code enable to collect the data, compute descriptive statistics, and create an interactive experience with the user.

It has been designed, based on user input such as a choice of city & period, to display answers of the following questions :

**1. Popular times of travel:** Most common month, day of week, hour of day
**2. Popular stations and trip:** Most common start station, end station, most common trip from start to end
**3. Trip duration:** Total travel time, average travel time
**4. User info:** Counts and percentage of each user type, gender (only available for NYC and Chicago), earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
**5. Raw data sample:** Display raw data upon user request

### Files used
**1. Python file :** bikeshare.py
**2. CSV data files:** The bikeshare.py file is calling .csv files that need to hosted in same directory:
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

*Note that for the file to work locally you’ll need to have locally installed:*
- Python 3, NumPy and Pandas librairies installed (recommended using Anaconda)
- A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows)

### Credits
This project has been realized for the Udacity Nanodegre course of “Programming for Data Science with Python".
